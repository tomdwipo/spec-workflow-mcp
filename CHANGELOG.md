- I have added a session.json in the .spec-workflow directory that stores the dashboard URL and the process ID of the dashboard server. This allows the agent to retrieve the dashboard URL as well as the user if required. Note: This should help users one headless systems where the dashboard us unable to auto load, you can retrieve the session information from the json file.
